Installation
============

`samr` works with Python3.3. If you know the drill, this should be enough:

    git clone https://github.com/rafacarrascosa/samr.git
    pip install -e samr -r samr/docs/setup/requirements-dev.txt
    download_3rdparty_data.py

If this doesn't work for you, read on.

Full instructions for Ubuntu
----------------------------

These instructions will install the development version of samr inside a
virtualenv and were made for a blank, vanilla Ubuntu 14.04 and tested using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Awesome tool btw). They should work
similarly with other Ubuntu versions and Debian-based OSs.

Open a console and 'cd' into an empty folder of your choice. Now, execute the
following commands:

Install python 3.3 and compilation requirements for numpy and scipy:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3.3 python3.3-dev gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev git

Create virtualenv and boostrap pip:

    python3.3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    python3.3 get-pip.py
    echo 'PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/local/bin:$PATH"; export PATH' >> venv/bin/activate
    source venv/bin/activate

Finally, clone and install samr:

    git clone https://github.com/rafacarrascosa/samr.git
    pip install -e samr -r samr/docs/setup/requirements-dev.txt
    download_3rdparty_data.py

Optionally run the tests:

    nosetests samr/tests
